		About
	</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		Spacejunk is a garment experiment developed by Teevee. All garments have been hand crafted using various techniques Teevee learned on his "Titan-Earth 1997 injection" journey from Titan circa 2400 to Earth circa 2000. After departing from Titan's Cosmo-Hill Satellite City, Teevee purchased an illegal time dilation ticket from R-C137 using credits he gathered from selling Kalaxian Crystals within Cosmo city. The Titan-Earth 1997 injection was a long lonely journey, and Teevee took this time to learn the outdated societal and cultural norms of humans in the 2000's, along with various "Art" techniques that had been illegal since the 2184 expression ban. Teevee chose this era because of its cultural positioning. Humans had just developed a digitally connected “Internet” that was not yet fully monitored or controlled. He chose these specific years as he felt the internet was still free. The secondary objective of the experiment was to to observe the impact of an ancient human legend, Dylan Reider.

		While Teevee does hate general galactic law, he admires the intracacy of the galactic federation's policy on "Universal Mechanical Material Relibility Bind In Single Linear Timelines" (UMRB_SLT-010) Because of this Teevee says that,

		Notes from teevee, "damn you need a quote, ok. Shit everything on here took forever. I made the clothes, I shot photos of the clothes, I edited those photos, I coded a website, and put all those photos on the website. I love it though, it was a lot of work but it's cool to have full creative controll of the process. But yea I guess that's my only comment about the site. I hope your life's been good, I've been doing pretty good. I've been thinking a lot about "
