		Words from Draw

		"Throughout life I’ve always felt an urge to personalize everything I own. In elementary school I started customizing my classmates LEGO mini figures with sandpaper and paint pens, and would charge a fee for each mini figure. I think spacejunk is just a continuance of whatever drove me to do things like that at a young age. I guess the only difference now is that I am customizing peoples outfits instead of their mini figures."

		Notes from teevee, "damn you need a quote, ok. Shit everything on here took forever. I made the clothes, I shot photos of the clothes, I edited those photos, I coded a website, and put all those photos on the website. I love it though, it was a lot of work but it's cool to have full creative controll of the process. But yea I guess that's my only comment about the site. I hope your life's been good, I've been doing pretty good. I've been thinking a lot about "
